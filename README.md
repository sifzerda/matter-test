## (1) Description

The Matter js demo code is collected here in JSX format for personal reference. This creates a front-end site with demos accessible by nav tabs. It was built with React, Matter.js, Node, Javascript, and CSS. 

I also created some examples including ball pit, bubbles, mousetrap, jigsaw, and bike.

## (6) Dev Stuff: Building:

1. Need pathseg polyfill:

The SVG and Terrain examples get this error:
```bash
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'body')
    at Body.setVertices (matter.js:1941:25)
    at Body.set (matter.js:1804:22)
    at _initProperties (matter.js:1730:14)
    at Body.create (matter.js:1688:9)
    at Bodies.fromVertices (matter.js:5506:29)
    at           Body.setVertices = function(body, vertices) {
        // change vertices
        if (vertices[0].body === body) {
            body.vertices = vertices;
        } else {
            body.vertices = Vertices.create(vertices, body);
        }
```

You have to use the [SVGPathSeg polyfill](https://github.com/progers/pathseg). Download pathseg.js and put into server folder (backend client/server) or client folder same level as index.html (front-end). Paste this into your index.html:

```bash
    <script src="pathseg.js"></script>
```

2. Need poly-decomp:

Need to install poly-decomp or you get this error:

```bash
matter-js: Bodies.fromVertices: Install the 'poly-decomp' library and use Common.setDecomp or provide 'decomp' as a global to decompose concave vertices.
```

Add this to the SVG component: 

```bash
import decomp from 'poly-decomp';

window.decomp = decomp;
```

## (8) Bugs and Further Development: 

- Some CSS formatting needed:
  - Resizing game screen window sizes
- Assets not loading in:
  - SVG
  - Jigsaw
  - Sprites
- Components not loading:
  - Air Hockey
  - Avalanche
  - Ball Pool
  - Terrain
- Components with no content:
  - Convex (need to add)
  - Motor

Optimization:
- use react-virtualized to only render visible stuff
- once game basically running, convert it into Redux or Zustand
- use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel to optimize build output: Enable code splitting, tree-shaking, and minification to reduce bundle size and improve load times.
- Consider memoizing components like Projectile and Particle using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially if their props rarely change.
